UPDATE: 

Hope all is well!

As far as how much I worked on this project:
* 1-3 PM Sunday
* 6-9 PM Sunday
* 8-10:30 PM Monday

The majority of Sunday was spent on learning nodeJS in order to have an understanding of what I was coding.

Today was mainly implementing. I understand the pages don't look great. I'd be more than happy to spend an hour or 2 tomorrow in order to improve them!

Thank you for giving me this chance!
It was a great experience.

UPDATE ENDS.






Good evening, hope all is well.

The API's are all function and deliver the desired results.

I used mySql to store the database. The API's were tested on postman and succesfully performed the [GET,POST,PUT,DELETE] operations.

What is left is implementing them on the frontend side which I sadly did not have time for today due to an unfortunate circumstance.

Feel free to test the API's!
