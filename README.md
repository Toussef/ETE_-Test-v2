Good evening, hope all is well.

The API's are all function and deliver the desired results.

I used mySql to store the database. The API's were tested on postman and succesfully performed the [GET,POST,PUT,DELETE] operations.

What is left is implementing them on the frontend side which I sadly did not have time for today due to an unfortunate circumstance.

Feel free to test the API's!
